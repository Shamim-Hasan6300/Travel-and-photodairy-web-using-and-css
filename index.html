                    I did a lot of amazing things last weekend. On Saturday, I went to Powell station with my best friend Victor. We were supposed to go to Sunset because many Americans had recommended that we visit that area. When we arrived at Powell, we found protestors who were against the war between the U.S. and Iran. We thought that if we stayed there, we could speak to a lot of Americans. So we decided to change our plans. Eventually, we succeeded in speaking with them for a long time and two of them invited us to their office. So we were able to get a bunch of information about the protests and politics in the USA. After spending 3 hours, we left the office, promising to visit there again. This was the first story of my amazing weekend.

On Sunday, I met two friends and we went to the Sunset area. We decided to take the Muni train. As I was buying my ticket, one of my friends pressed the button on the machine for kids 17 and under. We had no idea what would come next. When I tried to go through using that ticket, the machine started to make a siren sound… Oh My Goodness!! Unfortunately for me, there was a Muni police officer. I was trying to explain that it wasn’t my fault while she was writing my ‘precious’ $100 ticket! I couldn’t believe it!! I had to pay $100 instead of the $2.50. This is my second amazing story of my weekend. I didn’t know that there was another surprise waiting for me.

When we arrived in the Sunset area, we asked for directions to the beach from a university student. We just wanted to know how to get there. Not only did she give us directions, but she invited us to her apartment. I was so excited because it was my first time to be invited by an American to their place! And we did a lot of talking and had a lot of fun. It was amazing! Even though I experienced some bad things from the police, my weekend was awesome!
